can i use ``yarn install`` instead of ``pnpm install``  to install dependencies ?

I would recommend to use pnpm to have the exact dependencies we use. Although yarn should be okay and you can try to compile with foundry after if you want.

Some problems with ``scope.txt`` from the repo if you can solve,       ```packages/protocol/contracts/signal/ISignalService.sol``` is twice   and   ```packages/protocol/contracts/thirdparty.sol```  that is the directory with  .sol extension

``LibProposing.sol``  gives a compiler error  with   `` Undeclared identifier. Did you mean "blockhash"?``   `` meta_.blobHash = blobhash(0);``   ,   what should be instead  ?   ``blockhash`` or  ``blobHash``  ??   @d1onys1us


[03/06/2024 21:06] d1onys1us
Please update your compiler to latest one which support Cancun!


[03/06/2024 21:07] d1onys1us
By the way, hardhat / solidity extensions for VS code do not support Cancun yet as far as I know

This is not just because of wrong remappings.Its because  the file GovernorCompatibilityBravoUpgradeable.sol is not exist.

Hi I submitted two reports and they disappeared from the UI in less than 24hrs.


[03/10/2024 12:57] 0xsorrynotsorry
have you received mail confirmations for those?


[03/10/2024 12:58] .anas_22
Nope, although I use Hotmail so if it happened that problem is in my mail service.


[03/10/2024 13:01] 0xsorrynotsorry
I recommend submitting those again and confirming the mail receipts.
And opening a help desk request to give the C4 Team a heads up that you might have duplicate submissions since you couldn´t confirm the first batches´ success in here: https://code4rena.com/help


[03/10/2024 13:31] .anas_22

i'm here, but actually i'm trying to reproduce the issue. This is a good old "it works on my end" (regarding `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`) still.. 🙂 will keep trying.


[03/12/2024 10:50] dani_who_daniel
So it is an off-chain relayer service built for that.


[03/12/2024 10:51] dani_who_daniel
But also - via the UI - you can claim it for yourself -> in this case the neccessary proofs + message struct encoding will be put together within the ui.

[03/12/2024 11:12] dantaik
One thing that people can try is to delete pnpm-lock.yaml in the root dir and try `pnpm install` again

Is `TaikoL2._calcPublicInputHash()`'s purpose to ensure that anchoring happens for consecutive blocks only?


[03/12/2024 17:46] brechtpd
- yes ensures that the anchor function can only be called once in a block
- ensures that the block hash values returned by the ‘block hash’ opcode in the current block are consistent with previous blocks

Hey, why is the merkle trie proof in `Bridge.processMessage()` needed? Can't we just check if the signal is received by loading the value in the SignalService


[03/14/2024 00:50] dantaik
processMessage() is called on the destination chain, sending the siangal is on the source chain

[03/15/2024 06:15] kartoonjoy
Wardens: Assuming that these two issues are based on code being reviewed during this C4 audit, they are now out of play. Any finding submissions created beyond 9:26p CT (the time of the sponsors posting), will be NOT be awarded. Thank you!

No, will try to make sure we reward, since it was clearly our fault. We will figure out something, and sorry for any inconveniences - our intention was not bad at all, just also under time pressure as we need to proceed.

[03/15/2024 07:50] mrpotatomagic
If the submissions before that time are going to be awarded, please do that outside the C4 pot. There are still 13 days left for this audit and I'm sure there could've been duplicates. I think this would be fair to those who submitted the bug as well as other wardens who might've not reviewed those contracts yet.


[03/15/2024 08:13] haxatron1
It is fine to fix issues but _please_ do it in private repository that Github offers and not post fixes in the public repo which will compromise the fairness and integrity of the C4 contest.

[03/16/2024 06:47] dantaik
This is the case now. We are fixing things in our private repo, but you will still see some non-bug-fixing code changes in the open-repo, such as configuration changes, documentation improvements.


[03/16/2024 08:06] sockdrawermoney
**UPDATE:** We've had some discussions about the PRs.

In the interest of fairness, any findings addressed by the pull requests will be marked as out of scope.

We got together with and discussed how to make things right for wardens. **Taiko has agreed to boost the HM pool by $25k.** That update will be reflected in the repo soon.

We are very sorry this happened. It remains one of our top priorities to educate sponsor dev teams on how violating the code-freeze mid-audit breaks the C4 model.


[03/16/2024 08:09] haxatron1
But what about those wardens who submitted issues related to those PRs?


[03/16/2024 08:13] sockdrawermoney
The issues are now out of scope. It sucks a lot. But there is no good way to include them in the awards pool without breaking the model in one way or another.


[03/16/2024 08:15] haxatron1
Isn't it unfair to people like @Tendency who discovered the bug discussed with sponsor in private chat and then got their bug leaked

[03/16/2024 08:16] haxatron1
Hope there is some award for them outside of the award pool


[03/16/2024 08:19] sockdrawermoney
We have suggested this to the sponsor. We are aware there is no great solution. This has happened about 3 times in c4 history and it just always sucks. It’s why we are extremely restrictive of access during competitions


[03/16/2024 08:21] bytes032
We can't realistically know who have found the issue first (some guys just don't submit until last minute). Or they might have submitted already but didn't reach out to the sponsor.

But $25K increase for HM is 25% so imo it negates the damage cause if you've found more bugs you'd be rewarded even better.


[03/16/2024 08:22] bytes032
I had a *similar* situation with Ajna where I found a bug that wasnt really OOS, but the judge decided it was OOS, so Ajna rewarded separately.


[03/16/2024 08:41] kaveyjoe
dont know  about others but One issue that sponser fix by saying   found by @Tendency  c4 through discord  , so i think his finding should be  awarded .


[03/16/2024 08:48] 0xtendency
The outcome wasn't what i expected, but I think right now, the sponsors can't be forced to do more than what they have already.
25k added to the hm pot is good for us, any additional reward can only be out of good will
